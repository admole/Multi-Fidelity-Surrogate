# Test Configurations

This data contains a number of variations of the tandem cube case. The parameters that are varied are the yaw angel of the inlet velocity and an offset in the span-wise direction between the first and second cube.

## Inlet Yaw
Angles: $\theta$ = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

## Span-wise Offset
Offset: D = H/4, 2H/4, 3H/4, 4H/4, 5H/4, 6H/4
